## Setup
### Dependencies
I installed the following dependencies before starting the coding/building process:
    a. Node JS
        _https://nodejs.org/en/download_
    b. Express - A JS Framework used to create a backend application
        _npm install express_
    c. Nodemon - Allows us to run the server and append code changes in realtime
        _npm install nodemon_
    d. Request &
        _npm install request_
    e. Request-Promise - Used for making API requests
        _npm install request-promise_
    f. ScraperAPI - We use it to scrape useful data from the amazon website. It allows to scrape html off any site and turn it into a JSON formatted piece of content.
